## TPC-DI using Talend and SQL Server

### Introduction

TPC Benchmarkâ„¢ DI (TPC-DI) is a performance test of tools that move and integrate data
between various systems. Data Integration (DI) tools are available from a number of vendors,
but until now there has been no standard way to compare them. Such tools have also been
referred to as Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) tools at times. The benchmark workload
manipulates a defined volume of data, preparing the data for use in a Data Warehouse. The
benchmark model includes data representing an extract from an On-Line Transaction
Processing (OTLP) system being transformed along with data from ancillary data sources
(including tabular and hierarchical structures), and loaded into a Data Warehouse. The source
and destination schemas, data transformations and implementation rules have been designed
to be broadly representative of modern data integration requirements
